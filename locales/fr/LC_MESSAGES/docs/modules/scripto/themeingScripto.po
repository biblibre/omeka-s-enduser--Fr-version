"Scripto themes are a way to unite the look of a Scripto project with its "
"associated Omeka S site. You first associate a Scripto project to a site "
"by linking to the project from the site's navigation. In the Omeka S site"
" dashboard, go to the \"Navigation\" settings, and add \"Scripto\" to "
"your site's navigation. When a user comes to your site, that navigation "
"link will provide Scripto with your site context and apply the "
"accompanying Scripto theme."

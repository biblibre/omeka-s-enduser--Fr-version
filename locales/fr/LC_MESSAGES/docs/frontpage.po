"not necessarily connected. However, each installation has, by default, a "
"front page which lists the sites in the installation. This page is "
"accessed by going to the main url of your Omeka S installation; if your "
"[admin dashboard](admin-dashboard.md) was at "
"`yourdomain.net/omekas/admin`, then you would find this page a "
"`yourdomain.net/omekas/`"

"will only see public sites. A logged in Global Admin, by contrast, would "

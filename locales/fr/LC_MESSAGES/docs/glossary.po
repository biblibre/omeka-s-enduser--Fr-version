"The following glossary should help to clarify some of the less-familiar "
"terms in Omeka S. Where appropriate, we have provided a roughly analogous"
" term from Omeka Classic, although some analogies are stronger than "
"others."

"**Class**: A kind of Resource, as defined by a Vocabulary. Often, "
"Vocabularies expect particular Properties to be used with particular "
"Classes. For example, a `foaf:Person` would not have a "
"`dcterms:publisher` Property, but could be expected to have a "
"`foaf:familyName` Property.   *Omeka Classic analogy*: Item Type"

"**File**: Data uploaded to an Omeka S installation and associated "
"directly with an Item (see also: Media).     *Omeka Classic analogy*: "
"File (but the analogy is weak)"

"**Global Admin**: An administrator who controls everything, and is "
"typically the person who created the Installation.   *Omeka Classic "
"analogy*: Superuser"
msgstr ""

"**Installation**: An instance of Omeka S. Typically, a central IT "
"department of an institution does the process of installing, and probably"
" also creates sites for others."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/glossary.md:17 3be462ac0d6e433bb113285e8d4d56e4

"**Item**: The records used to build an Omeka S Site. Items are shared and"
" available to any Site in an Installation, unless explicitly excluded "
"from sharing.   *Omeka Classic analogy*: Item"

"**Item Set**: An aggregation of Items. Items can belong to any number of "
"Item Sets.   *Omeka Classic analogy*: Collection, Items with the same tag"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Media**: Additional representations or descriptions of an Item, beyond "
"metadata from vocabularies. Typically, this refers to a File (of any "
"type, including, e.g., text or HTML snippets), but could also refer to "
"external data sources such as a YouTube video, Slideshare deck, Dspace "
"bitstream, etc.       - *Omeka Classic analogy*: File (but the analogy "

"**Property**: A defined — to one degree or another — kind of metadata "
"used to describe a Resource. The most common is dcterms:title, for the "
"written, human-readable title of an Item. The Values for Properties can "
"be written language intended for humans or other sentient beings to read "
"(‘Literals’), Resources (understood here as internal to an Omeka S "
"Installation), or External URIs (e.g., a URI to a DBpedia resource page)."
"   *Omeka Classic analogy*: Element"

msgid ""
"**Resource Template**: A set of pre-defined Properties, and optionally a "
"Class, to use to guide Item creation and interpretation of Properties. "
"Typical usage is to create a template for, e.g., a `foaf:Person` that "
"makes Items using that template show the inputs for the expected or "
"desired `foaf: properties`, and sets the Class of the Item to "
"`foaf:Person`.   *Omeka Classic analogy*: Item Type (but the analogy is "
"weak) cf. Class"

"**Value**: The actual data that fills out the Resource-Property-Value "
"triple. If the property is 'dcterms:title', a reasonable Value might be "
"“Heart of Darkness”. Literal Values might also have information about the"
" language in which that Value is expressed attached. Values can also be "
"Resources or URIs to external data (preferably URIs that return RDF data,"
" but I don’t think we’re going to enforce that).    *Omeka Classic "
"analogy*: Element Text"

msgid ""
"**Vocabulary**: A collection of published RDF metadata Classes and "
"Properties for describing a Resource. These exist and are created "
"externally to Omeka, and can be imported (with some limitations) into "
"Omeka S for use throughout the Installation. The most-used Vocabulary is "
"Dublin Core Terms (dcterms:).   *Omeka Classic analogy*: Element Set"

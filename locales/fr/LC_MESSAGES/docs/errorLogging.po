"If you are experiencing problems with your Omeka S installation, or you "
"want to turn on development-style error tracking, you can do so in two "
"different ways. You will need to edit the `.htaccess` and/or "
"`local.config.php` files, depending on which way you choose. You must use"
" a ftp or terminal client to do so; if you're not sure how to do this, "
"please contact your system administrator or hosting provider."

"One option is to enable on-page display of error details. This will cause"
" \"Omeka S has encountered an error\" pages to show the error message and"
" details instead of a generic message, and also will display PHP-level "
"errors and warnings on pages if they occur."

"details of all errors to a file. Any \"Omeka S has encountered an error\""
